	<h1>Why Cats are better than Dogs</h1>
<p>Science studies many things most people may deem pointless. Not the study of cats, however. Owning a cat has lead to lower stress-levels, which in turn lowers your risk of heart disease. Not only that, but children raised in the presence of cats (kids at <1 year or thereabouts) have higher chances of immunity to many common allergies, aside from just general pet alergies. Furthermore, while not beneficial from a health point of view, a study was conducted that showed that 90% of women believe that men with cats are nicer and more caring than those without.</p>
<p>Whether any of that science mumbo-jumbo has any standing in reality, I personally have no idea. What I do know is that Dr. Seuss created a character by the name of Cat in the Hat. Did he create a character called "Dog in the Hat"? No he did not.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need further convincing? Look  no further than the table below.</p>
