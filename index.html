    <article1 class="introduction">
	     <p>You've probably been asked if you're a dog person or a cat person. Some people love both animals. But if you had to live with only one, which would you choose?</p>
	 
	     <p> From my perspective, I prefer Dogs, but that's not mean i hate Cats. Let's </p>
	 
	      <p>Let me introduce you some reasons why i think Dogs are better than Cats </p>
	<h2>Here's the Reasons Why Dogs Are Better Than Cats</h2>
    </article1>

    <article2 class="1st reason">

	     <h1>1. Dogs Can Protect You</h1>
	     <img src="images/image2.jpg" width="450" height="250">
	     <p>It's not in a cat's nature to defend you or your home. Cats are more likely to run and hide when faced with trouble.</p>
	     <p> On the other hand, most dogs will instinctively protect their owners and their territory. They'll bark or growl to alert you to the presence of strangers, and many will even scare off intruders. Dogs can sense our fear and they'll respond if they think we feel threatened.</p></article2>

	     <h1>2.More Control Means Less Destruction</h1>
	     <img src="images/image3.png" width="450" height="250">
	    <p>If you try to control a cat and you might hear the tiny sound of kitty laughter. Most cats will go where they want to go, jump where they want to jump, scratch where they want to scratch, and mark whatever they think needs marking. Then there are those hairballs, which are most easily found when you're barefoot in the middle of the night.</p>
	     <p>You can usually crate train a dog and keep him and your home safe and secure while you're away. Most crate-trained dogs consider their crates to be their own special places.</p></article3>

		<h1>3.Human's Best Friend</h1>
		<img src="images/image4.jpg" width="450" height="250">
		<p>Dogs have been domesticated for 15,000 to 35,000 years or more. Dogs have been the faithful companions and loyal helpers of the human race throughout history.</p>
		<p>Cats seem to know that they were once worshiped as gods. Perhaps they resent the fact those days have ended. They may still be holding it against us.</p></article4>

		<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
		
		<h2>Unconditional love from Dogs
</h2>
        <img src="images/image5.jpg" width="450" height="250">
        <p>Cats are complicated. Dogs are not. A dog will love you every minute of every day.

         Scientists at Emory University conducted a study that proved it, too. Using MRI technology, they were able to show the reward center of doggy brains lit up like fireworks when they smelled their ownerâ€™s scent.</p>
